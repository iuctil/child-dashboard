## Our Beginning

In the **spring of 2020**, Elkhart County leaders were worried that the county-wide decrease in child abuse reporting was not actually due to declining child abuse rates. They came together to plan action around this data trend. After multiple community meetings, several organizations came together to **train over 170 front-line reporters** on child abuse prevention, raising reporting rates. This **fruitful collaboration**—based on sharing an important data trend—sparked the idea to track local statistics and trends related to Elkhart County children’s safety and wellbeing, and that idea became the **Elkhart County Child Dashboard**.
