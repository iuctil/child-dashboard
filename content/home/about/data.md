## Indicators

A dashboard *indicator* is a data point that provides **quantitative information** that can tell us something about child wellbeing and safety in the county. No single data point is perfect or tells the full story, but by looking at data points from across many organizations and sectors, we hope to be able to see the most important trends in child wellbeing and safety in our county and be able to respond nimbly and proactively as a community to make a difference.

Dashboard indicators must meet the following **three criteria**:

- Can inform and drive action
- Sourced from a trusted sharer/representative
- Value of the indicator to the community is worth the effort required to obtain the data

## Dashboard Data

You will see **two types of indicators** on the dashboard: **publicly available data** (such as unemployment rate) and **local partner data** that comes from an Elkhart County organization that is willing to regularly share a specific data point.

Partners providing local data are selected with the following **criteria** in mind:

1. Are in some way representative of the sector (i.e., YWCA is well placed to share a data point connected to incidences of domestic violence and care seeking for domestic violence)
1. Have a good reputation and are respected by peer and partner organizations
1. Have given input in an iterative process to determine what data they might provide that would meet the indicator criteria
